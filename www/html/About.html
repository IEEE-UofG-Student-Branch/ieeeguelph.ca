              We host a variety of events each year to help students achieve these goals, such as different workshops, guest speakers, job networking events,
              hackathons, coding competitions, and more.

              The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers is an international organization that aims to standardize and advance research in various
              electro-technologies such as quantity storage in computers, medical devices, and networking. Students who show interest and join the club will
              have the opportunity to attend various networking events, seminars, and workshops, providing students the opportunity to interact with engineers
              in various electricity related professions.
